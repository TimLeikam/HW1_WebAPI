REST writeup

REQUEST RAW:
GET - using HTTP version 1.1
    - using the link specified in the assignment
Accept - encoded gzip (type of data?)
       - deflate (take out whitespace?)
Host - the server being contacted (www.googleapis.com)
Connection - keep-alive (stay connected?)
User-Agent - Apache-HttpClient/4.1.1 (java 1.5)
    -The server is using Apache and http, I'm using...something and java

RESPONSE RAW:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK - Connected fine using http version 1.1
Expires (date/time) - my connection timeout
Date - when the response came in
Cache-Control: private, max-age = 0, must-revalidate, no transform
     -Private line, one time connection, must send credentials on each connection, no idea what transform would be
ETag - id of the session?
Vary:Origin - no idea
Vary:X-Origin - no idea
Content-Type - it will return json data using the character set utf-8
x-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - no idea
X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN - no idea
X-XSS-Protection: 1;mode=block - secure connection?
Content-Length: 26982 - I'm guessing it's the total characters returned because there's not 27,000 lines of json data that I get
Server - which server sent the response?
Alternate-Protocol:443:quic, p=0.02 - which protocols were used by my machine and the server to communicate

NOTES
I couldn't get it to test the existence of a title in volumeInfo in the item list.
I tried a plethora of different things and couldn't get it to be valid in the
assertion.  I even tried adding it to the outline of the response object but
the added assertion just wouldn't save.
